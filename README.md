# Santi AI V1
Prerquisities:
This app is not standalone in this version. You may have problems in some installations.
I use
* Python 3.9.9
* Kivy 2.0
but you can try to run it on different versions.
Most of the features I use are just the basics.
Kivy may cause more problems for different versions, but IDK.

I guess you can run it on the console mode even if you don't use Kivy.
Because the mode check doesn't import Kivy on console mode.

Default mode: GUI mode
To use:
* Download the files into a folder
* Run main.py
* Write your message into the input box
* Press the button
* Repeat as many times as you want

The AI will tell you if it knows your message and how many times you said it.  
If the message is not remembered, the AI will tell that it doesn't know, and memorize the message.
The AI will remember previous sessions as long as the memory file is kept safe by the user.

Console mode:
Similar to GUI mode, but you work with console outputs.
I don't like this, because I don't like complex console GUIs.
I want to add many options on GUI, so this will be quite abandoned.
