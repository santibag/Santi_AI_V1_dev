# Santi AI V1
To use:
* Run main.py
* Write your message
* Repeat as many times as you want
* Kill the console to quit in this version

The AI will tell you if it knows your message and how many times you said it.  
If the message is not remembered, the AI will tell that it doesn't know, and memorize the message.
The AI will remember previous sessions as long as the memory file is kept by the user.
