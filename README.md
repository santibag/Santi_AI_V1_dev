Very noobish AI

I was believing that AI is generally very important.
I wanted to get into AI blindly to get some insight before checking what other people does.

This AI will probably be very primitive. I have no idea how much V1 will go.
I guess I will end this when I learn about new things at some point.

My general plan is to use AI as an assistant.
Yes, there is Google Assistant and stuff but I still wanted to make one because it will be mine.
This can also work with Google Assistant or other AI anyway. We will see.
